The editor also uses react-window for efficient rendering of lines, even in very large files.\n\n⚠️ Warning!\nThis project is a work in progress and does not represent the quality of a finished product. It was created as a way to explore Electron and desktop application development with React. Many features are planned: Terminal, Refactoring, Git integration, support for more languages, settings panel, auto-completion, global search and refactoring, etc.\nIt is recommended to use real code editors such as VSCode or IntelliJ when working on your own development projects.",
